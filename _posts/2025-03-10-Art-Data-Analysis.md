Case Study from Google Data Analytics Capstone Project: [Google Data Analytics Capstone](https://www.coursera.org/learn/google-data-analytics-capstone)

## Introduction
In this case study, I will perform data analysis on the art auction dataset collected by *Kangsan Lee et al.*. This dataset was initally found on the [Data Is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/archive/2024-08-07-edition/) website and also was published [here](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60957-z). I will use this dataset to analyze trends and patterns for a fictional art magazine client and highlight the main pieces for consideration in future publications.

## Context
Working for a fictional art magazine client, the company wants to analyze trends and patterns found on art auctions to highlight insights in the art market. To do so, they want to see which styles, mediums, and artists are gaining in popularity. The editor wants to identify up and coming patterns that can resonate with art enthusiasts and readers to help drive which topics to highlight in future articles. For example, if the data shows a rise in demand for a specific style, the editorial team can focus on these areas to stay ahead of the industry. This not only extends to  magazine/print media but also for publishing web-based articles as well. 

## Step 1: Ask

**Business Task**: Analyze art auction data to identify trends and help guide editorial content for future publications.

**Analysis Questions**: The stakeholders and team brainstormed a few possible questions to help find trends within the data.
- What genres/mediums of art has been rising within the past few years?
- What regions have been identified as highest revenue for art auction transactions?
- Is there a correlation between different auction houses and revenue?

For this case study, we'll touch on each question to give an overall idea for further actions.

## Step 2: Prepare
### Data Source
As mentioned before, the data source is from the art auction dataset collected by *Kangsan Lee et al.*. The [paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-024-60957-z) includes a link to the [data source](https://springernature.figshare.com/articles/dataset/Buying_a_Work_of_Art_or_an_Artist_Exploring_the_Impact_of_Visual_and_Social_Features_on_Art_Prices/24746268) that contains 9 files. One of which includes the *transactions.csv* which will be the focus of this analysis.

This is a public data source that includes 34200 records of art auctions which contains market information about the artworks, artists, and regions of where the art originated. This includes around 590 artists and data about the pieces ranging from 1996-2012. There is also information about the ages of the artwork, prices, and art auction houses of where the pieces are sold.

### Considerations/Limitations
While the data is comprehensive in listing out key features of the art auction dataset, it should be noted that there are some considerations when interpreting the results:
- This dataset only considers artists that are currently alive and within the top 1000 according to [ArtFacts.net](https://artfacts.net/). As such, having a comprehensive table would only be limited to living artists and well-known to the general public.
- The data only ranges from 1996-2012 so the data may not be current and is only within this time range.
- When imported to a spreadsheet, some values are not necessarily numerical/or contains errors. One notable example includes how the table for the price_usd in USD also contains '.' values instead of N/A or 0.
- In addition to artists that are well known, this dataset also excludes information about artists without a biography or public information about their careers.
- One of the columns did contain links to images but since our analysis is mostly featured on identifying trends and patterns in numerical/categorical data, that column was deleted to be consistent.
- Column names did not initially follow the proper formatting guidelines so some time would be spent to ensure formatting issues will be taken care of.

## Step 3: Process
I used PostgreSQL to verify my data integrity. There is over 34200 records of art auctions and while I could use a spreadsheet tool such as Excel or Google Sheets, I am familiar with SQL and its usage in calculating data queries.

For now, since this is just one data table, data combining is not an issue and I can focus on data exploration.

### Data Exploration
My goal for now is to identify columns that contain NULL Values. 

From my basic SQL queries, I quickly found out that *year_of_birth* and *year_of_artwork* contains NULL values. 

```
SELECT * FROM transactions
WHERE year_of_birth IS NULL OR year_of_artwork IS NULL;
```
Out of the over 34200 rows, I received a total of 12387 rows that contain NULL Values. That is a major problem. Most of the errors come from the *year_of_artwork* column but the *year_of_birth column* has less than 10 entries total. 

Fixing this would not take as long as I can manually enter the results in PostgreSQL and those issues should dissapear.

Ex: I manually type in John Miller *year_of_birth* to 1931 for its respective entries. 

As for the others in the *year_of_artwork*. It would become my choice to determine if those data entries are valid. Doing some further digging, the website that collected the data did not include the date so those values of NULL would be considered.

Going through the list I would need to find the number of NULLS in each column to consider which data should be used. In SQL, it would take a long time but I can create a function in each column in Excel that uses the COUNTBLANK function for each column.

Below is the number of NULLS calculated in Excel for each column:

| column           | number|
|------------------|-------|
| case_id          | 0     |
| sales_id         | 0     |
| lot_num          | 0     |
| artist_name      | 0     |
| lot_title        | 0     |
| nationality      | 0     |
| year_of_birth    | 9     |
| year_of_artwork  | 12386 |
| genre            | 0     |
| auction_house    | 0     |
| country_or_city  | 2124  |
| lot              | 0     |
| price_usd        | 0     |
| cpi              | 1928  |
| real_price_usd   | 22033 |
| ln_real_price    | 22033 |
| price_eur        | 28433 |
| price_gbp        | 20822 |
| event_name       | 2793  |
| event_date       | 0     |
| event_year       | 0     |
| bidding_currency | 20822 |
| currency         | 20822 |
| Ham_Prem         | 20822 |
| estimate_min     | 14867 |
| estimate_max     | 21037 |
| est_currency     | 0     |
| materials        | 0     |
| height           | 0     |
| width            | 0     |
| depth            | 0     |
| biography        | 0     |
| size_inch        | 0     |
| price_per_inch   | 0     |

From here, we can narrow our scope of the data based on NULLs. I would argue that we want artworks that are sold and in the price in USD for accessibility so we can drop the *cpi*, *real_price_usd*, *ln_real_price*, *price_eur*, and *price_gbp* where artworks contain NULL values in those columns. I would also argue that we can filter out values that have NULLs in *country_or_city* and *event_name* as we want published results that have transactions at events featured in the magazine.

When we dropped the columns, now we can filter out even more data that may not be needed. We could probably ensure that artworks need to have a monetary value so *bidding_currency*, *currency*, *Ham_Prem*, *estimate_min* and *estimate_max* would be filtered out to not include NULL values.

From here, we have a table that is proper and can be processed for further analysis. We filtered out a CSV file that had over 100000 rows that is now reduced to 70000 rows. 

Link to Documenation of Filtered Data in SQL: TBD 

## Step 4: Analyze
For this, we will use a combination of R and SQL. R would be the best case for data visualization as not only can we produce visualizations pretty quickly but it is also the best for static reports.

We can also use SQL to filter out results even more if needed and for easier processing into R for tables.

We are going to analyze the data to answer the following questions.

- What genres/mediums of art has been rising within the past few years?
- What regions have been identified as highest revenue for art auction transactions?
- Is there a correlation between different auction houses and revenue?

### Trends of Art Genres
First off, let us see overall the trends in art genres over time.

![Revenue Trends by Year of Art Genres](dataVisuals/q1_revenueByGenre.png)

Based on overall trends, paintings and sculptures make up a large majority of the revenue from auction houses over time. Both experience growth from 1995-2008 and 2009-2015. While 2016 does show a dramatic dip in revenue, this is due to limited data collected in 2016. At its peak, paintings represent over $1 billion dollars in sales and sculptures made up more than $250 million dollars in revenue.

This is also apparent when distributing revenue as percentages over time.
![Revenue Trends by Year of Art Genres in Percentage](dataVisuals/q1_salesVolume.png)

When it comes to yearly revenue, paintings by far take up a significant chunk of sales volume with over 50% of revenue coming from that medium throughout the recorded time periods. It is overall a positive trend from 1995 to 2015 barring a dip in 2008. 

### Regions and Art Transactions
If we were to analyze revenue by locations, there is a noticeable gap between the top 2 locations and the rest.

![Region Performance](dataVisuals/q2_revenueByLocation.png)

As indicated, New York and London dominates the art market by contributing at least $8 billion dollars combined. We can infer this due to the major art houses in the area which includes Sotheby's and Christie's. This is not to downplay the other locations as areas such as Paris and Hong Kong generates substantive revenue based on its historical art market and an Asian hub for sales respectively. While New York and London takes up a significant portion of the total revenue, secondary markets including Paris, Hong Kong, Cologne, India, and much more can be inferred of having influence in both regional sales and trends.

### Art House and Revenue Distribution

Let's look at how each auction house is distributed based on the number of art pieces and total revenue.

![Art House Distribution](dataVisuals/q3_auctionHousebyNumberofPieces.png)

From the graph itself, we used a scatterplot to show the relationship in quantifying the number of art pieces and total revenue and to see if there is a correlation. There are a few takeaways from the chart. Both Sotheby's and Christie's are high performers in both the number of pieces and revenue. Both auction houses have over 18000 pieces each sold and over $3.5 billion dollars in revenue with Sotheby slightly ahead. 

There is a surprise performer in Phillips as while it has few art pieces listed in the market, its revenue is significantlly large to be considered as a major contributor to the total revenue. 

The far majority however in the bottom left cluster of the graph handles far fewer art pieces and generate lower revenue. So we can infer that these auction houses may focus on more niche mediums, artists that are not well known in the art community, or focus on lower-prices artworks. 

There are two major groups in approaching revenue for the auction houses. If there is an auction house with significant revenue and resources such as Sotheby's and Christie's, they are more likely to have a large collection of artworks and can make up a large portion of the revenue focusing on that. If there is a smaller auction house, the strategy would be to focus on local artists and mediums which would lead to smaller revenues. Phillips is the exception as it generates higher revenue from fewer pieces but probably focus more on well-known artists or high-profile sales.


If we were to focus on each of the art houses it does reveal a bit more about the trends in individual pieces as data points.
![Art House Distribution](dataVisuals/q3_distributionOfArtPrices.png)

Listed are the top 10 auction houses listed by total revenue. Each of the data points represents an art piece that is based on the price sold and distributed across the graph. 

Already, Sotheby's and Christie's are listed as having the most data points and range of prices with some prices going over $30 million dollars. However, when compared to the rest of the top 10 auction houses, the vast majority of artworks are either at or below the $1 million dollar range. 

This is reinforced by the median price of each auction house as this verifies that only a few locations make a substantial portion of overall prices and high-value sales.

## Conclusion
For our client for the art magazine, we can showcase data on the art transactions and provide some key findings to help suggest some reccomendations for the marketing of the magazine.

Reccomendations:
1. Since Sotheby's and Christi'es dominate a significant portion of the art market, focus significantly on content or art pieces within those auction houses to appeal to major hub cities and a broad audience.
2. If local editions of the magazine are available, combining the major auction hosues with regional specific art auctions may provide long term value by showcasing local engagement with the art community and broader relevance of artists.
3. Paintings and sculptures make up the largest share of the revenue and that would be the major focus for publication. However, when well-known artists or a high-profile sales occurs, it should also be highlighted when relevant either for a specific theme, event, or focus in the media.
